## Design Philosophy

### Weird West Elements
- Supernatural coexists with mundane
- Mystery and ambiguity preferred
- Not everything explained

- Voodoo and folk magic
- Mad science and impossible tech

### Cryptic Over Clear
- Figures speak in riddles and metaphors
- Hints rather than explanations
- Players piece together truth
- Multiple interpretations possible
- Unreliable narrators
- Contradicting information

### Moral Complexity
- No purely good or evil figures
- Questionable methods for good ends
- Justice vs. mercy dilemmas
- Consequences for all choices
- Some problems have no solution
- Player agency paramount

### Atmosphere Over Mechanics
- Mood and tone prioritized
- Evocative descriptions
- Psychological horror elements
- Sense of cosmic insignificance
- Beauty in tragedy
- Hope in darkness
