## Feature Comparison Matrix

### 1. Core Resolution Mechanics

| Feature | Torn | AAA | Therian Saga | Oregon Trail | **Desperados** |
|---------|------|-----|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Combat system | Stat-based PvP | Alien battles | Turn-based clicking | Typing speed | **Destiny Deck (poker)** |
| Skill checks | Hidden rolls | Hidden rolls | Skill requirements | Random events | **Card draws with suit bonuses** |
| Unique mechanic | Nerve bar | Guild protection | Async task queue | Permadeath | **Poker hand = outcome quality** |

**Analysis:** Desperados Destiny's **Destiny Deck system** is entirely unique - no inspiration source uses poker hands for resolution. This differentiates the game significantly. Torn uses hidden stat comparisons, AAA uses straightforward combat, Therian Saga requires skill thresholds, and Oregon Trail uses random number generation with typing challenges.

### 2. Progression Systems

| Feature | Torn | AAA | Therian Saga | Oregon Trail | **Desperados** |
|---------|------|-----|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Skill count | ~8 stats | ~6 stats | 9 professions | None | **30 skills across 4 categories** |
| Max level | Unlimited | ~100 | ~50 per trade | N/A | **99 per skill** |
| Prestige system | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Score multiplier | **✅ 15+ tiers** |
| Offline progression | Limited | Limited | **✅ Full async** | ❌ | **✅ Training continues** |
| Character permadeath | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅** | **✅ Optional** |

**Analysis:** Desperados takes Therian Saga's **asynchronous progression** (training while offline) and combines it with Torn's **long-term character investment**. The 30-skill system (Combat 5, Cunning 8, Spirit 6, Craft 11) far exceeds any inspiration, and the prestige system adds Oregon Trail's replayability factor.

### 3. Economy & Trading

| Feature | Torn | AAA | Therian Saga | Oregon Trail | **Desperados** |
|---------|------|-----|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Player marketplace | **✅** | **✅** Flea Market | **✅** | ❌ | **✅** |
| Property ownership | **✅** Multiple | ❌ | **✅** Housing | ❌ | **✅ Full real estate** |
| Business ownership | **✅** Companies | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ Multiple types** |
| Stock market | **✅** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ Investments** |
| Crafting economy | Limited | **✅** Smithing | **✅ Deep** | ❌ | **✅ 588 recipes, 11 professions** |
| Resource gathering | ❌ | **✅** Mining/Herbs | **✅** | Hunting only | **✅ Mining/Fishing/Hunting** |

**Analysis:** Desperados builds the most comprehensive economy by combining:
- Torn's **stocks, properties, and companies**
- AAA's **mining, smithing, and flea market**
- Therian Saga's **deep crafting chains** (raw → refined → components → items)
- Oregon Trail's **hunting for survival**

The result is an **EVE Online-lite economy** in a text-based western setting.

### 4. Social & Faction Systems

| Feature | Torn | AAA | Therian Saga | Oregon Trail | **Desperados** |
|---------|------|-----|--------------|--------------|----------------|

| Marriage system | **✅** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| NPC relationships | Limited | ❌ | Limited | ❌ | **✅ Trust levels + schedules** |

**Analysis:** Desperados adopts Torn's **faction warfare and territory control** but enhances it with the three-faction system (Settler Alliance, Nahi Coalition, Frontera). The NPC relationship system with schedules and trust levels exceeds all inspirations.

### 5. Criminal Activities

| Feature | Torn | AAA | Therian Saga | Oregon Trail | **Desperados** |
|---------|------|-----|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Crimes | **✅ Extensive** | Thievery career | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ Full system** |

| Fencing stolen goods | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ Trust-based fences** |
| Disguises | ❌ | Costumes (cosmetic) | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ Functional disguises** |

**Analysis:** Desperados takes heavy inspiration from Torn's **crime system** (Crimes 2.0 with time-based success rates) but adds western flavor: train robberies, stagecoach ambushes, bounty hunting, and the unique fence/disguise systems not present in any inspiration.
