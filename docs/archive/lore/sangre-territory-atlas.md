**Founded**: Ancient (permanent settlement ~1863 as reservation headquarters)
**Faction Control**: Nahi Coalition (Elder Wise Sky, War Chief Red Thunder)
**Strategic Value**: Defensible position, spiritual center, last major Coalition territory

**Description**:

Kaiowa Mesa rises 800 feet above the surrounding desert, its sheer red cliffs making it nearly impossible to assault directly. The mesa top (approximately 2 square miles) has been the Kaiowa people's sacred home for millennia.

- **Water Source**: Natural spring (sacred, never runs dry)

**Faction Control**: Settler (mining destroyed it in 1867)
**Strategic Value**: None (destroyed), Symbolic (Coalition grief)

**Description** (Before Destruction):

A pristine spring flowing from canyon wall, surrounded by cottonwood trees. Water was pure, cold, never ran dry even in drought. Site of Tseka ceremonies, vision quests, healing rituals for thousands of years.

- Choice: Help healing OR encourage vengeance

**2. "Restore the Spring"**:
- Impossible quest (or is it?)

- Success would unite Coalition, failure breaks hearts again

### Significance

This location exists primarily as **environmental storytelling** and **emotional weight**:

*"Every canyon, every spring, every stone in this territory holds a story. Some are beautiful. Some are tragic. Some are still being written - by bullets, by treaties, by the turning of cards. The Sangre Territory is not just a place. It's a crossroads where cultures clash, where spirits walk, and where destiny deals its hand."*
