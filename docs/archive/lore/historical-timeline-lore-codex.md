## INTRODUCTION & PURPOSE

This codex serves as the **canonical historical and mythological foundation** for Desperados Destiny. Every quest, NPC, location, and faction draws from this shared history. The timeline spans **100 years (1775-1875)** leading to the game's present moment, explaining how the Sangre Territory became the powder keg it is today.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Moderate Depth**: Red Dead Redemption 2-level worldbuilding - rich and authentic without overwhelming
- **Mythic Realism**: Historical authenticity blended with supernatural "weird west" elements
- **Three-Perspective History**: Events seen differently by Settler, Nahi, and Frontera cultures
- **Player-Discoverable**: Most lore revealed through gameplay, not exposition dumps

**Usage for Developers:**
- Reference when creating NPCs, quests, locations
- Ensure cultural consistency across all content
- Understand faction motivations and historical grievances
- Ground supernatural elements in established mythology

## BEFORE TIME: THE ANCIENT WORLD

### The First People and The Land

Long before European ships touched American shores, long before the concept of "nations" crystallized, the First People lived in harmony with the land that would become the Sangre Territory. They were not the unified "Nahi Coalition" of 1875 - that term came later, born of desperate necessity. They were separate nations: the **Kaiowa** of the mesas and high country, the **Tseka** of the canyon rivers, and the **Nahi** of the desert borderlands.

Each nation had its own language, customs, and relationship with the land. But they shared one understanding that transcended tribal boundaries:

**The Sangre Territory was sacred ground. It was Kia'ta - "The Thin Ground."**

### The Thin Ground (Kia'ta)

The ancestors knew what settlers would one day feel in their bones but never understand: the Sangre Territory was a place where the **spirit world and physical world touched**. The barrier between realms grew gossamer-thin here, particularly in certain places:

- The **Canyon of Echoes** where voices of the dead could be heard
- **Thunderbird's Perch** atop the highest mesa where storms were born
- The **Whispering Stones** that sang in languages no living person spoke
- **Ancestor's Spring** where visions came unbidden to those who drank

The elders taught that this thinness was not accident, but **ancient design**. The land itself was alive, sentient in ways beyond human comprehension. And beneath the red earth, something vast and old slumbered.

### The Ancient Pact

According to the oldest stories - the ones told only by firelight, the ones that made even hardened warriors uneasy - the First People made a covenant with the land itself millennia ago.

**The legend speaks of a time of great hunger and death.** The people were dying, their children starving, the game animals vanished. In desperation, the greatest shamans of all three nations gathered at what is now called **The Scar** - a massive canyon fissure that plunges into absolute darkness.

They performed a ritual that lasted nine days and nine nights. On the final night, **something answered from below**.

The shamans never spoke of what they saw or what bargain they struck. But when they emerged, the land bloomed again. The game returned. The people survived.

The price? **Blood and respect.**

The land demanded blood - not through sacrifice, but through living and dying upon it, spilling your essence into the soil across generations. In return, the people would respect the sacred places, honor the spirits, and **never dig too deep**.

For thousands of years, this pact held.

### The First Warning

In the stories, there was always a warning embedded:

> *"The land sleeps because we feed it our lives, our stories, our blood. But if strangers come who do not honor the old ways, who tear the earth for yellow metal and split the sacred stones for their iron roads... what sleeps beneath may wake. And the Thin Ground will tear wide open."*

The elders in 1775 still told these stories. By 1875, most have seen enough strangeness in the Sangre Territory to believe every word.

### What-Waits-Below

The entity beneath the Sangre Territory has many names across cultures:

- **Kaiowa**: *Tsa'ke-nai* ("The Dreaming Hunger")
- **Tseka**: *Owa'sha-keth* ("That Which Swallows Stars")
- **Nahi**: *Kesh'va* ("The Old Root")
- **Settler folklore** (by 1875): "What-Waits-Below" or "The Sangre Devil"
- **Mexican/Frontera tradition**: *El Devorador* ("The Devourer")

No culture agrees on exactly what it is:
- A primordial god older than humanity?
- A geological entity, living stone and magma given consciousness?
- A thought-form created by millennia of belief?
- The land's immune system, protecting itself?

What all agree: **it exists, it is vast, it is old, and disturbing the deep places angers it.**

### The Supernatural Ecosystem

The Ancient Pact created a supernatural ecosystem in the Sangre Territory that persists into the game's present:

**Spirit Beings** are objectively real - ancestor spirits guide worthy descendants, trickster spirits play deadly games, land guardians protect sacred sites.

**Legendary Beasts** roam the wilderness - the Thunderbird nests in the high peaks, skinwalker packs hunt the canyons, things without names lurk in The Scar.

**Sacred Sites** pulse with power - spending time at these locations can grant visions, blessings, or drive you mad depending on your worthiness.

**The Thin Ground effect** means supernatural encounters are more frequent here than anywhere else in the American frontier. This isn't superstition or folklore. It's as real as the sunrise.

### Historical Mystery Note

**For Game Design**: The truth about the Ancient Pact, What-Waits-Below, and the Thin Ground is revealed gradually through the episodic story framework. Players will piece together:

1. **Early game**: Unexplained supernatural encounters, fragmented legends
2. **Mid-game**: Pattern recognition - the supernatural follows rules
3. **Late game**: The full scope of the Ancient Pact and what it means
4. **Endgame mystery**: What happens when the railroad and mining truly violate the pact?

This creates a **six-layer mystery** called "The Great Mystery" that spans the entire game's narrative arc.

## ERA I: FIRST CONTACT (1775-1845)

### 1775-1799: The Spanish Borderlands

**The Sangre Territory in 1775** sits on the far northern frontier of New Spain's colonial empire. Spanish missionaries and soldiers have established a few scattered presidios (forts) and missions in the region, but their control is tenuous at best.

**Key Characteristics of This Era:**
- Spanish colonial presence is minimal and largely peaceful
- The three native nations (Kaiowa, Tseka, Nahi) maintain territorial sovereignty
- Trade relationships develop between Spanish settlers and indigenous peoples
- The term "Frontera" emerges to describe the lawless borderlands
- First reports of supernatural phenomena by Spanish priests (dismissed as "native superstition")

**1782: The Mission at Sangre Canyon**

Franciscan missionaries establish **Mission San Miguel del Sangre** in what will eventually become the town of Red Gulch. The name "Sangre" (blood) comes from the distinctive red stone of the canyon walls, which glow crimson at sunset.

The mission priest, **Father Esteban Mendoza**, keeps detailed journals documenting the region. His writings include:
- Descriptions of native spiritual practices (respectful and curious, unusual for the time)
- Reports of "voices in the canyons" and "lights that move with intelligence"
- Documentation of the Whispering Stones and other sacred sites
- First written record of the legend of What-Waits-Below

Father Mendoza disappears in 1789 while exploring The Scar. His journals are recovered and eventually archived in Mexico City. (These journals become a discoverable lore item in-game.)

**1790s: Peaceful Coexistence**

For roughly two decades, an uneasy but generally peaceful coexistence exists:

- Spanish settlers trade goods (horses, metal tools, cloth) for local knowledge and food
- Some cultural exchange occurs - language borrowing, intermarriage
- The native nations maintain their territories and sacred sites
- The Frontera begins to attract those fleeing Spanish law - early outlaws, renegades, mestizo traders

**Nahi Perspective**: The Spanish are tolerated as long as they respect sacred sites and don't dig too deep. Some elders are concerned about the mission's location near Ancestor's Spring, but the priests seem respectful.

**Settler Perspective** (later historical interpretation): This was the "golden age" of the frontier, when different peoples lived in harmony. Conveniently ignores the power imbalance and colonial intentions.

**Frontera Perspective**: A time of opportunity when the law's reach was weak and fortunes could be made through trade, cunning, and occasional violence.

### 1800-1821: Growing Spanish Presence

As the 19th century begins, Spanish colonial ambitions grow:

**1803**: Rumors of rich gold and silver deposits draw prospectors to the region. The first mining claims are staked in the foothills, far from sacred sites. Initial mining is small-scale and doesn't trigger supernatural backlash.

**1810-1821: Mexican War of Independence** impacts the region:
- Spanish colonial administration collapses
- The Sangre Territory becomes even more lawless during the chaos
- Many Spanish settlers flee; others stay and intermarry with locals
- The Frontera swells with refugees, deserters, and opportunists
- Native nations maintain neutrality but secure trade deals with both sides

**1815: The First Disturbance**

A Spanish mining operation near **Thunderbird's Perch** attempts to extract a rich silver vein. Local Kaiowa shamans warn them they are violating sacred ground. The warnings are ignored.

**Result**: A freak lightning storm destroys the mining camp, killing 23 miners. Survivors report seeing a massive bird-shaped shadow in the clouds and hearing a scream that shattered eardrums. The mine is abandoned and never reopened.

This incident becomes a legend in the region - proof to the natives that the land protects itself, dismissed by later settlers as "unfortunate weather."

### 1821-1845: Mexican Territory

**1821**: Mexico gains independence. The Sangre Territory is now officially part of Mexico, though Mexican government control is minimal.

**Key Developments:**
- The term "Frontera" becomes formalized - the borderlands between Mexican civilization and wilderness
- Vaquero culture flourishes - Mexican cowboys develop techniques later adopted by American ranchers
- Small Mexican settlements established: **El Paso del Sangre** (later becomes "The Frontera" outlaw town)
- Trade routes develop, including smuggling networks
- Native nations continue to hold most territory but face increasing pressure

**1835: The Comanchero Trade Network**

A complex trade network develops between native groups, Mexican traders (Comancheros), and American frontier merchants. The Sangre Territory becomes a crucial hub due to its central location.

**Goods traded:**
- Horses (often stolen from Texas and Mexican ranches)
- Buffalo hides and furs
- Firearms and ammunition
- Captives (a dark aspect of this history that causes moral tension)
- Precious metals from small-scale mining

This network creates economic ties between cultures but also increases tensions and violence.

**1840: The Whispering Stones Incident**

An American surveying expedition attempts to document the **Whispering Stones** - a ring of ancient standing stones that emit strange sounds. The surveyors attempt to remove one stone to study it.

**Result**: All seven surveyors go mad. Three kill each other. Two commit suicide. Two survive but speak only in unknown languages for the rest of their lives. The stone, once removed from its position, becomes an ordinary rock.

The incident is documented in U.S. Army reports and becomes another "cautionary tale" that settlers will later dismiss as exaggeration.

### 1845: The Eve of American Expansion

By 1845, the Sangre Territory exists in a fragile balance:

**Kaiowa, Tseka, and Nahi Nations**: Control most of the land, maintain sacred sites, engage in limited trade, growing increasingly worried about American expansion they've heard about from eastern tribes.

**Mexican Settlers**: Small communities, vaquero ranchers, missionaries, traders. Generally have learned to respect (if not fully understand) the supernatural aspects of the territory.

**The Frontera**: A growing outlaw haven, attracting deserters, criminals, and those who thrive in lawless spaces. Multinational and multicultural by necessity.

**American Presence**: Minimal but growing. Trappers, traders, scouts reporting back to the U.S. government about the region's resources.

**The Supernatural**: Still in balance. The Ancient Pact holds because sacred sites remain undisturbed, and those who violate them suffer consequences that keep others cautious.

**This balance is about to be shattered.**

---

## ERA II: GROWING TENSIONS (1846-1866)

### 1846-1848: The Mexican-American War

The war transforms the Sangre Territory overnight from a remote borderland to a contested strategic location.

**1846: War Reaches the Territory**

- U.S. Army cavalry units move through the region pursuing Mexican forces
- The native nations declare neutrality but provide intelligence to both sides for payment
- The Frontera thrives as both armies need supplies and look the other way at smuggling
- Several skirmishes occur near El Paso del Sangre

**1847: The Battle of Sangre Canyon**

A significant battle occurs in the canyon where Mission San Miguel once stood. Mexican forces use knowledge of the terrain to ambush U.S. cavalry.

- 89 U.S. soldiers killed
- 34 Mexican soldiers killed
- The canyon walls are said to have "run red with blood" (giving further credence to the Sangre name)
- Survivors on both sides report supernatural experiences during the battle (shadow figures, disorienting sounds, weapons misfiring without explanation)

**Nahi Perspective**: The spirits are disturbed by so much violence in sacred spaces. Elders perform cleansing rituals after the battle.

**1848: Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo**

Mexico cedes the territory to the United States. The Sangre Territory is now American land.

**Immediate Impact:**
- Mexican settlers must choose: accept U.S. rule, return to Mexico, or resist
- Most stay but face discrimination and lose land rights
- The Frontera becomes even more lawless as former Mexican soldiers, U.S. deserters, and outlaws flood in
- Native nations are horrified - they never ceded their lands to Mexico, so how can Mexico give it to America?

**1849: First Treaties and First Betrayals**

U.S. agents arrive to negotiate treaties with the Kaiowa, Tseka, and Nahi.

**The Fort Laramie Treaty (1849)** is presented as recognizing native sovereignty in exchange for:
- Safe passage for American settlers
- Right to establish military posts
- Access to certain resources

The native leaders, recognizing the military reality of U.S. power, reluctantly agree.

**The problem**: The treaty is intentionally vague about what "safe passage" means and contains no protections for sacred sites.

### 1850-1860: The Slow Invasion

**1850-1855: Settlers Arrive**

The trickle becomes a stream:
- Ranchers claim vast tracts of land (often including sacred sites, unknowingly)
- Small farming communities establish
- Trading posts and supply stations built
- First permanent U.S. military post: **Fort Ashford** (named after the territorial commander)

**Cultural Clash:**
- Settlers are unaware of sacred geography and violate sites through ignorance
- Supernatural incidents increase - livestock deaths, mysterious disappearances, strange lights
- Settlers blame "Indian raids" (rarely the actual cause)
- Native nations try diplomatic protests but are ignored

**1853: The Red Gulch Settlement**

American settlers establish a permanent town near the ruins of Mission San Miguel. They name it **Red Gulch** after the red canyon stone.

Red Gulch grows rapidly:
- 1853: 200 residents (miners, ranchers, shopkeepers)
- 1855: 800 residents
- 1858: 1,500 residents
- Becomes the de facto capital of the territory
- U.S. territorial government established here in 1855

**1856: First Supernatural Fatalities (American)**

A rancher named **Jacob Thornton** attempts to build a cattle fence through the **Whispering Stones**. His workers report the stones "screaming" as they dig post holes.

Over three weeks:
- 5 workers die (accidents: trampled by horses, fall from scaffolding, lightning strike)
- 8 workers quit, terrified
- Thornton himself is found dead, tangled in his own barbed wire

His widow, **Martha Thornton**, abandons the claim. She becomes one of the first settlers to publicly state "there's something wrong with this land" and advocates for respecting native warnings.

Her granddaughter, **Eliza Thornton**, will become a journalist documenting the supernatural in 1875 (see NPC Database).

**1857: The First Armed Conflict**

Prospectors begin mining operations in the **Sacred Heart Mountains** (so named by settlers, unaware the Kaiowa call them "The Guardians").

The Kaiowa Nation sends warriors to peacefully turn them back. The miners refuse. A standoff escalates into violence:
- 12 miners killed
- 7 Kaiowa warriors killed
- U.S. Army cavalry dispatched

**Result**: The miners are escorted out but the U.S. demands the Kaiowa responsible stand trial. The Kaiowa refuse. Tensions escalate dramatically.

**1858: The Broken Treaty**

U.S. authorities claim the Kaiowa have violated the 1849 treaty through "unprovoked attacks." A new treaty is imposed:

- Kaiowa territory reduced by 40%
- Sacred sites "protected" but open to U.S. supervision
- Mineral rights granted to U.S. government
- Monthly food rations promised in compensation (rarely delivered)

Elder **Wise Sky** (then a young shaman) leads resistance:
- Organizes peaceful protests
- Appeals to U.S. officials (ignored)
- Attempts to educate settlers about sacred sites (mocked)

The Kaiowa, Tseka, and Nahi hold a historic gathering. For the first time in their history, they discuss **formal alliance** against American expansion.

### 1859-1861: The Edge of War

**1859: Small-Scale Resistance**

Native warriors begin targeted attacks:
- Mining operations in sacred areas are sabotaged (not attacked, just destroyed)
- Survey markers removed
- Supply wagons ambushed (goods taken, people usually released unharmed)

The U.S. press calls it "The Sangre Uprising." In reality, it's limited, strategic resistance.

**1860: The Railroad Survey**

The **Central Pacific Railroad** sends surveyors to map potential routes through the Sangre Territory. The proposed route goes directly through:
- Kaiowa Mesa (sacred site)
- Ancestor's Spring (most sacred water source)
- The edge of The Scar

When native leaders see the survey maps, they understand this is an existential threat.

**Elder Wise Sky's famous speech** (translated):

> *"They want to drive an iron snake through the heart of Kia'ta. They want to split the Thin Ground with their rails and ties. They do not understand what they are doing. They think the spirits are stories. They will learn the land has teeth."*

**1861: The Civil War Changes Everything**

The American Civil War begins. The U.S. Army pulls most troops from the frontier to fight in the east.

**Immediate Impact:**
- The Sangre Territory is suddenly under-defended
- Settler communities panic
- Confederate sympathizers try to claim the region for the South
- Native nations see an opportunity to reclaim land
- The Frontera explodes in size as deserters and refugees flee west

**1861-1865: The Chaos Years**

For four years, the Sangre Territory descends into near-anarchy:

**Native Nations**:
- Reclaim much lost territory
- Destroy survey markers and mining operations
- Avoid large-scale war but establish dominance through raids
- Formally create the **Nahi Coalition** (1863) - first unified native government

**Settlers**:
- Form vigilante militias for protection
- Some abandoned settlements
- Others fortify (Red Gulch builds wooden palisades)
- Civilians die in raids and counter-raids

**The Frontera**:
- Becomes a major outlaw haven
- El Paso del Sangre is renamed simply **"The Frontera"** by locals
- Outlaw gangs control smuggling, raiding, extortion
- Neutral ground where all sides trade (unofficially)

**Supernatural Activity**:
The violence and chaos causes a surge in supernatural encounters:
- Spirits disturbed by constant bloodshed
- Reports of shadow figures on battlefields
- Mass hysteria incidents in Red Gulch (1864)
- Cattle mutilations blamed on "demons" or "witches"

**1865: The War Ends, The Reckoning Begins**

The Civil War ends. U.S. troops return to the frontier with new veterans hardened by brutal warfare.

The federal government views the western territories as:
- Economic opportunity (resources needed to rebuild)
- Military problem (native resistance must be crushed)
- Destiny (Manifest Destiny ideology stronger than ever)

**The stage is set for the Gold Rush and the final conflict.**

---

## ERA III: THE GOLD RUSH & THREE-WAY WAR (1867-1875)

This is the most detailed era as it leads directly into the game's present moment (1875). Every event here shapes the current factions, conflicts, and supernatural situation.

### 1867: The Gold Strike

**March 1867: Discovery**

A prospector named **Samuel "Goldfinger" Harrison** discovers a massive gold vein in the **Sangre Canyon**, approximately two miles from the town of Red Gulch.

The vein is extraordinarily rich - assays suggest millions of dollars in gold. Word spreads like wildfire.

**What the prospectors don't know**: The vein runs directly beneath the **Ancestor's Spring**, one of the most sacred Tseka sites. Mining it will require digging deep into the aquifer that feeds the spring.

**April-June 1867: The Rush Begins**

- Over 3,000 prospectors flood into Red Gulch
- Tent cities spring up overnight
- Prices skyrocket (a single egg costs $1, a month's wages for many)
- Violence erupts over claim disputes
- The Tseka Nation watches in horror as miners swarm toward their sacred spring

**July 1867: The Tseka Ultimatum**

Tseka leaders deliver a formal ultimatum to Red Gulch's mayor and the mining companies:

> *"The spring is the heart of our people. The water flows from the ancestors. If you poison this water, you poison us. Leave now, or we will make you leave."*

The mayor, **William "Big Bill" Harrison** (cousin of the discoverer), responds:

> *"This is American land now. The gold is ours by right. If you attack American citizens, the full force of the U.S. Army will fall upon you."*

**August 1867: The Spring Dries Up**

Mining operations begin. Within weeks, **Ancestor's Spring stops flowing**.

The Tseka interpret this as the land itself withdrawing from the treaty, a sign that the Ancient Pact is breaking.

What actually happened (scientifically): Mining disrupted the underground aquifer. What also happened (supernaturally): The spirits abandoned the site, and strange phenomena begin occurring near the mines.

**September 1867: The Tseka Attack**

At dawn on September 15th, 1867, **200 Tseka warriors** attack the main mining camp.

- 47 miners killed
- 8 Tseka warriors killed
- Gold shipment seized and thrown into the canyon
- Mining equipment destroyed

The Tseka withdraw before U.S. troops arrive, but a line has been crossed.

### 1868: The Military Response

**January 1868: Fort Ashford Reinforced**

The U.S. Army sends 400 cavalry troops under **Colonel (later Captain) Marcus Cross** to "pacify the natives and secure American economic interests."

Cross is a Civil War veteran known for brutal tactics. He views native peoples as obstacles to civilization and has no interest in diplomacy.

**February-April 1868: The Scorched Earth Campaign**

Cross launches a campaign of:
- Burning native villages (including non-combatant settlements)
- Destroying food caches before winter
- Shooting buffalo herds to starve native populations
- Taking hostages to force surrender

**The Massacre at Quiet Creek (April 1868)**:

Cross's cavalry attacks a peaceful Nahi village at Quiet Creek while the warriors are away hunting.

- 89 civilians killed (mostly elders, women, children)
- Village burned to the ground
- Survivors flee to Kaiowa Mesa

This atrocity unites the three nations like never before. The **Nahi Coalition** becomes a true military alliance.

**Nahi Coalition Response**:

**Elder Wise Sky** and **War Chief Red Thunder** lead a coordinated counter-attack:

- Ambush supply caravans
- Attack isolated cavalry patrols (warriors vs. soldiers only)
- Use knowledge of the terrain to outmaneuver larger forces
- Employ guerrilla tactics learned from centuries of intertribal warfare

**May 1868: The Battle of Thunderbird's Perch**

The largest battle of the conflict occurs when Cross attempts to attack the Coalition stronghold on Kaiowa Mesa.

**Forces**:
- U.S. Army: 380 cavalry
- Nahi Coalition: 250 warriors (Kaiowa, Tseka, Nahi)

**Result**:
- Coalition victory through superior positioning
- 103 U.S. soldiers killed
- 31 Coalition warriors killed
- Cross retreats, humiliated

**Supernatural Element**: Multiple soldiers report seeing a massive bird-shaped shadow over the battlefield and hearing a scream that caused horses to panic. Coalition shamans later claim they called the Thunderbird to aid them. Skeptics blame acoustics and exhaustion.

### 1869: Stalemate and the Rise of the Frontera

**The Military Stalemate**

By mid-1869, neither side can achieve decisive victory:

**U.S. Army advantages**:
- Superior numbers and equipment
- Supply lines from the east
- Legal authority

**Nahi Coalition advantages**:
- Terrain knowledge
- Mobility and guerrilla tactics
- Spiritual resolve
- Supernatural assistance (maybe)

**The conflict settles into a grinding war of attrition.**

**The Frontera Exploits the Chaos**

As settlers and native peoples fight, **the outlaw Frontera thrives**:

- Both sides need supplies, weapons, intelligence
- The Frontera sells to whoever pays (no loyalty)
- Outlaw gangs raid both settler and native settlements
- The Frontera town becomes a neutral trading ground (enforced by outlaw codes - no fighting in town)

**Key Frontera Figure: "El Rey" Martinez**

A former Mexican Army officer turned outlaw leader, **Carlos "El Rey" Martinez**, consolidates power in The Frontera. He establishes:

- Neutral ground rules (violence in town punished by death)
- A fence network for stolen goods
- Protection rackets for both settlers and native traders
- A rough code of honor (the "Frontera Code")

By 1869, The Frontera is a de facto independent city-state answering to no government.

### 1870-1871: The Supernatural Escalation

As the war intensifies and sacred sites are increasingly violated, supernatural activity surges dramatically.

**1870: The Canyon Wyrm Appears**

Miners working deep in the Sangre Canyon report attacks by a massive serpentine creature.

- 23 miners killed over three months
- Descriptions vary: some say giant snake, others say dragon, others say "living stone"
- Nahi shamans identify it as a **Guardian Spirit** awakened by the violation of sacred earth
- Mining in the deep canyon stops (the richest veins are left unmined)

**1870: The Pale Rider Sightings**

Multiple reports emerge of a **ghostly rider on a white horse** appearing before battles and disasters.

- Seen by both settlers and native scouts
- Described as skeletal or corpse-like
- Appears, points toward danger, then vanishes
- Those who heed the warning survive; those who ignore it die

Becomes the most famous supernatural legend of the period.

**1871: The Skinwalker Panic**

Several settler communities report attacks by "shapeshifters" - humans who transform into animals.

- Livestock slaughtered in ritualistic patterns
- People vanish from locked rooms
- Witnesses describe wolf-human hybrids

**The Complexity**: Skinwalkers are real in Nahi tradition, but they're witches who violate sacred laws. The Coalition denies responsibility and even aids in hunting the skinwalker pack (which includes rogue members of all three nations, plus settlers who learned forbidden rituals).

The **Skinwalker Pack** becomes a permanent supernatural threat, independent of faction.

**1871: The Whispering Stones Massacre**

A cavalry unit chases Coalition warriors to the **Whispering Stones**. Despite warnings, the soldiers enter the stone circle.

All 34 soldiers are found dead the next morning:
- No wounds
- No signs of struggle
- All positioned as if they sat down and simply stopped living
- Their weapons neatly stacked in the center of the circle

The Coalition warriors insist they never touched them. "The stones took them," they say.

The U.S. Army officially blames poison (despite no evidence). Soldiers privately refuse to go near the stones ever again.

### 1872-1873: The Railroad Comes

**1872: Railroad Construction Begins**

The **Central Pacific Railroad** begins construction from the east toward the Sangre Territory, despite the ongoing war.

**The Route**: Will cross through Kaiowa lands, requiring:
- Land cession
- Mining rights for ties and fuel
- Protection from native attacks

**The Railroad Treaty (1872)**:

The U.S. government offers a "final treaty":
- Nahi Coalition gets a defined reservation (30% of original territory)
- Monthly food rations guaranteed
- Schools and medical care promised
- Railroad allowed through
- All sacred sites "protected" (vague definition)

**Coalition Response is Split**:

**Elder Wise Sky's faction**: Accept the treaty. Continued war means extinction. Save what can be saved.

**War Chief Red Thunder's faction**: Reject the treaty. Fight to the last warrior. The land itself will rise to defend us.

**The Coalition Fractures (1872)**:

The unity of 1868 breaks. Roughly 60% accept the treaty, 40% refuse.

**Those who accept**:
- Move to the reservation on Kaiowa Mesa
- Begin the painful transition to reservation life
- Try to preserve culture within the new constraints
- Become the "Treaty Faction" of the Coalition

**Those who refuse**:
- Continue guerrilla resistance
- Raid railroad construction
- Allied with some Frontera outlaws who oppose the railroad (it will bring law)
- Become the "Resistance Faction"

By 1875, both factions still exist within the Coalition, creating internal political tension.

**1873: Railroad Reaches the Territory**

The first railroad tracks reach the Sangre Territory in November 1873.

**Immediate Effects**:
- Red Gulch population explodes (3,000 to 8,000 in six months)
- Goods flow in, gold flows out
- The Frontera prospers (easier to fence stolen goods)
- Resistance faction attacks increase but can't stop progress
- Settler Alliance consolidates (railroad brings law and civilization)

**Supernatural Event - The Iron Horse Incident**:

On the first full train journey through Coalition lands, the locomotive derails near Kaiowa Mesa despite no visible obstruction.

- 9 dead, 34 injured
- Survivors report seeing a spectral buffalo stampede across the tracks
- Railroad engineers find no mechanical cause
- Nahi shamans claim the spirits sabotaged it
- Railroad adds armed guards and increases speed through "Indian country"

### 1874: The Three Powers Emerge

By 1874, the chaotic war has crystallized into three distinct power blocs that will define the game's present (1875):

**The Settler Alliance**

**Who They Are**:
- Red Gulch settlers, ranchers, miners
- Railroad company interests
- U.S. territorial government
- Fort Ashford military garrison
- "Law and order" faction

**What They Want**:
- Complete control of the Sangre Territory
- Economic exploitation (gold, silver, copper, lumber)
- Railroad expansion
- "Civilizing" the frontier
- Elimination of native resistance and outlaw threats

**Their Justification**:
- Manifest Destiny (divine right to the land)
- Progress and civilization
- Legal ownership (U.S. government purchased from Mexico)

**1874 Leader**: **Governor Edmund Ashford** (territorial governor, nephew of the fort's namesake)

**The Nahi Coalition**

**Who They Are**:
- Kaiowa, Tseka, and Nahi nations in fragile alliance
- Treaty Faction (on reservation) + Resistance Faction (guerrilla fighters)
- Allied with sympathetic Frontera outlaws
- A few settler allies (rare but they exist)

**What They Want**:
- Protect sacred sites at all costs
- Preserve culture and autonomy
- Honorable survival for their people
- Recognition of treaty violations
- The railroad stopped or rerouted

**Their Justification**:
- The land was theirs for thousands of years
- The Ancient Pact (spiritual responsibility)
- Settlers violated every treaty ever made
- They're defending their home

**1874 Leaders**:
- **Elder Wise Sky** (spiritual leader, Treaty Faction)
- **War Chief Red Thunder** (military leader, Resistance Faction)

**The Frontera**

**Who They Are**:
- Mexican-American border outlaws
- American outlaws fleeing the law
- Deserters from both armies
- Smugglers, bandits, mercenaries
- Anyone who doesn't fit in the other two factions

**What They Want**:
- Autonomy and freedom from law
- Profit from the conflict (sell to both sides)
- Keep the territory chaotic (chaos = opportunity)
- No faction achieving total victory

**Their Justification**:
- The territory is too lawless to be ruled
- They were here before the settlers and will outlast them
- Freedom above all else
- Survival of the clever and strong

**1874 Leader**: **"El Rey" Carlos Martinez** (de facto boss of The Frontera town)

**The Three-Way War**:

By 1874, it's not a simple settler vs. native conflict. It's a complex three-way struggle:

- **Settler vs. Coalition**: Land and ideology war
- **Settler vs. Frontera**: Law vs. chaos
- **Coalition vs. Frontera**: Some Frontera raid native lands; others ally with them
- **Frontera internal conflicts**: Gangs fight each other for territory and pride

No one can win decisively because:
- Settlers have numbers but can't control the wilderness
- Coalition has terrain and spirits but can't stop the railroad
- Frontera has mobility and ruthlessness but can't hold territory

### 1875: The Present Moment (Game Start)

**January 1875: The Second Gold Strike**

A new massive gold vein is discovered deep in **Sangre Canyon**, even richer than the first.

The problem: It's directly underneath **The Scar** - the most sacred and dangerous site in the entire territory.

**February 1875: The Governor's Proclamation**

Governor Ashford announces:
- Mining rights granted to the **Ashford Mining Company** (his family's company)
- Full military protection for miners
- Any interference will be considered "insurrection" and met with force

**March 1875: The Coalition Ultimatum**

Elder Wise Sky and War Chief Red Thunder issue a joint ultimatum (the first time they've agreed on anything in two years):

> *"The Scar must not be opened. We do not make this demand for ourselves, but for all people. What sleeps below must not be awakened. Mine there, and we go to war until extinction."*

**The Frontera Chooses Sides**:

Some outlaw gangs ally with the Coalition (they fear what mining The Scar might unleash).
Others ally with the Settlers (the mining operation needs supplies and protection).
Most stay neutral and plan to profit from the chaos.

**April 1875: The Supernatural Surge**

As mining equipment is transported toward The Scar, supernatural activity spikes:

- The Pale Rider appears in Red Gulch (first time in a settlement)
- The Canyon Wyrm is seen near the surface
- Thunderbird sightings increase
- Spirits appear even to skeptics
- The Whispering Stones scream audibly for the first time

Even hardened skeptics admit "something is wrong."

**May 1875: The Game Begins**

This is where players enter the story.

**The Situation**:
- The Sangre Territory is a powder keg about to explode
- Three factions vie for control
- The supernatural world is increasingly agitated
- The Ancient Pact is breaking
- What-Waits-Below is stirring

**The Stakes**:
- Will the Settlers conquer the territory and unleash what sleeps below?
- Will the Coalition preserve the sacred sites and their culture?
- Will the Frontera exploit the chaos or choose a side?
- What happens if The Scar is mined?

**Players decide the outcome through their actions, faction allegiance, and choices.**

## THE THREE POWERS OF 1875

### Settler Alliance - Detailed Profile

**Official Name**: The Sangre Territorial Government & Allied Interests

**Population**: ~12,000 in the territory
- Red Gulch: 8,000
- Mining camps: 2,500
- Ranches and farms: 1,000
- Fort Ashford: 500 soldiers

**Government Structure**:
- **Governor**: Edmund Ashford (appointed by U.S. president)
- **Territorial Legislature**: 12 members (all land-owning men)
- **Marshal**: Kane Blackwood (law enforcement chief)
- **Military Commander**: Captain Marcus Cross
- **Railroad Representative**: Not yet assigned (railroad company influence)

**Key Institutions**:
- Fort Ashford (military garrison)
- Red Gulch Town Council
- Ashford Mining Company
- Central Pacific Railroad (under construction)
- Territorial Court (judge appointed by governor)
- Two newspapers (both pro-settler)

**Ideology - Manifest Destiny**:

The core belief system:
- American expansion is divinely ordained
- "Civilizing" the frontier is a moral duty
- Native peoples are "savages" who must assimilate or perish
- The land's resources should be exploited for progress
- Democracy and capitalism are superior to all alternatives

**Internal Divisions**:

**The Hardliners** (led by Captain Cross):
- Want complete military subjugation of natives
- Support unlimited mining regardless of consequences
- View the Frontera as criminals to be hanged
- "The only good Indian is a dead Indian" mentality

**The Moderates** (led by Marshal Blackwood):
- Want peaceful integration where possible
- Willing to negotiate with Coalition Treaty Faction
- Concerned about supernatural incidents
- Believe in rule of law (even for natives and outlaws)
- "Civilization through law, not massacre"

**The Profiteers** (led by Governor Ashford):
- Only care about economic exploitation
- Will negotiate or fight based on what's profitable
- Corrupt - take bribes, sell offices, embezzle funds
- View the territory as personal enrichment opportunity

**The Faithful** (ministers and missionaries):
- Want to convert natives to Christianity
- Believe in "saving souls" through assimilation
- Some genuinely compassionate, others paternalistic
- Divided on whether salvation requires cultural genocide

**Strengths**:
- Superior numbers and growing population
- Industrial technology (railroads, telegraphs, modern weapons)
- U.S. government backing and resources
- Economic power (gold mines generate massive wealth)
- Legal authority (in their view)

**Weaknesses**:
- Ignorance of the land and its supernatural aspects
- Internal corruption and division
- Supply lines vulnerable to raids
- Morale issues (soldiers fear the supernatural)
- Many settlers just want to live in peace, not fight

**Cultural Traits**:
- Protestant work ethic
- Rugged individualism
- Belief in progress and technology
- Racial hierarchy assumptions
- Gun culture and frontier justice
- Saloon culture and gambling (despite official morality)

**Relationship to the Destiny Deck**:

Settlers view poker/gambling as entertainment and metaphor for life ("you play the hand you're dealt"). They don't understand the spiritual significance the Coalition sees in the cards.

Many settlers are beginning to notice that the Destiny Deck system seems to work too well - that cards really do reflect fate. But they rationalize it as coincidence or psychology.

### Nahi Coalition - Detailed Profile

**Official Name**: The Allied Nations of Kaiowa, Tseka, and Nahi (Coalition for short)

**Population**: ~4,500 total
- Kaiowa Nation: ~2,000 (mostly on reservation)
- Tseka Nation: ~1,500 (split between reservation and wilderness)
- Nahi Nation: ~1,000 (most still in traditional territories)
- Resistance fighters: ~300-500 (fluid number)

**Government Structure**:

**Council of Elders** (Traditional authority):
- Three representatives per nation (9 total)
- Decisions made by consensus
- Spiritual leaders hold great influence
- Women have voice in council (matrilineal traditions)

**Key Figures**:
- **Elder Wise Sky** (Kaiowa) - Spiritual leader, Treaty Faction
- **War Chief Red Thunder** (Tseka) - Military leader, Resistance Faction
- **Medicine Woman Silent Rain** (Nahi) - Healer and seer
- **Young Chief Running Fox** (Kaiowa) - Warrior, bridge between factions

**The Two Factions**:

**Treaty Faction (~60% of Coalition)**:
- Accept the reality of U.S. power
- Live on the Kaiowa Mesa reservation
- Try to preserve culture through adaptation
- Focus on protecting most sacred sites through negotiation
- "Survive today to fight tomorrow"

**Resistance Faction (~40% of Coalition)**:
- Reject all treaties as illegitimate
- Continue guerrilla warfare
- Live in hidden camps in the wilderness
- Willing to die for the land
- "Die free or live as slaves - we choose death"

Both factions cooperate on existential threats (like mining The Scar) but conflict over tactics.

**Ideology - Sacred Balance (Hesa)**:

The core belief system:
- The land is alive and sacred, not property
- Humans are stewards, not owners
- The spiritual and physical worlds are connected
- Balance (Hesa) must be maintained
- The Ancient Pact is real and binding
- Ancestors and spirits guide the living

**Cultural Values**:
- Communal ownership (what's mine is ours)
- Oral tradition and storytelling
- Respect for elders and tradition
- Warrior honor and courage
- Connection to nature as identity
- Vision quests and spirit guidance
- Matrilineal descent and female leadership in some contexts

**Spiritual Practices**:
- Vision quests (ritual isolation seeking spirit guidance)
- Spirit walking (shamans traveling between worlds)
- Ancestor veneration
- Sacred site protection and ritual
- The Destiny Deck as divine language (cards speak fate)
- Medicine ceremonies (healing body and spirit)

**Strengths**:
- Intimate knowledge of terrain
- Supernatural allies (spirits, guardians, legendary beasts)
- Guerrilla warfare expertise
- Moral clarity and spiritual resolve
- Coalition unity (when achieved) is powerful
- Some settler sympathizers provide intelligence

**Weaknesses**:
- Vastly outnumbered and outgunned
- Internal division (Treaty vs. Resistance)
- Reservation dependency on unreliable government rations
- Younger generation torn between tradition and assimilation
- Limited access to modern weapons and supplies
- "Sacred site defense" constrains strategic options

**Relationship to the Destiny Deck**:

The Coalition sees the Destiny Deck as sacred - **the language of fate itself**. When cards are drawn, they reveal the will of the spirits and the balance of Hesa.

- Skilled warriors have favor with the spirits (skill bonuses represent spiritual strength)
- Randomness is not chance but divine will
- The four suits represent the four sacred aspects of existence
- Poker hands are prophecy made visible

**Three Nation Distinctions**:

**Kaiowa** (The Mountain People):
- Live on high mesas and sacred peaks
- Expert horsemen and scouts
- Thunderbird is their patron spirit
- Matrilineal clan structure
- Most likely to accept treaties (pragmatic)

**Tseka** (The River People):
- Live in canyons near water sources
- Expert swimmers and fishermen
- Water spirits and ancestor spirits strongest here
- Emphasis on healing and medicine traditions
- Most hurt by mining (destroyed their sacred spring)

**Nahi** (The Desert People):
- Live in arid borderlands
- Expert trackers and survivalists
- Connected to trickster spirits and coyote mythology
- Most integrated with Mexican/Frontera culture
- Most militant resisters (least to lose)

### Frontera - Detailed Profile

**Official Name**: None (they reject official organization)

**Colloquial Names**:
- The Frontera (the borderlands)
- "Outlaw Country"
- "El Territorio Libre" (The Free Territory)

**Population**: ~2,000 (fluid - people come and go)
- The Frontera town: ~800 permanent residents
- Outlaw camps: ~500 in various gangs
- Drifters and transients: ~700

**"Government" Structure**:

There is no formal government, but there is order:

**"El Rey" Carlos Martinez**:
- De facto leader of The Frontera town
- Enforces the Frontera Code (outlaw rules)
- Commands largest gang (~50 members)
- Respected for fairness and ruthlessness

**The Frontera Code**:
1. **No violence in town** (instant death penalty)
2. **Honor debts** (welching = exile or death)
3. **No betraying other Frontera to outsiders** (solidarity)
4. **Respect duels** (formal challenges must be honored)
5. **Share information** (everyone benefits from intelligence)
6. **Territory is earned** (only the strong hold land)
7. **Freedom above all** (no one rules another)

**Key Power Brokers**:
- **El Rey Martinez** - Town boss, smuggling king
- **"Sidewinder" Susan Valdez** - Gang leader, horse thief, feared gunslinger
- **"Prophet"** - Mysterious fortune teller, supernatural broker
- **Tomas Vega** - Saloon owner, information broker
- **Various gang leaders** (6-8 major gangs operate from The Frontera)

**Ideology - Lawless Freedom**:

The core belief system:
- All governments are oppressive
- Freedom means taking what you can hold
- Loyalty is to your gang/crew, not abstract nations
- Honor among outlaws (debts, duels, codes matter)
- Survival of the cunning and strong
- The frontier belongs to those bold enough to take it

**Cultural Mix**:

The Frontera is uniquely multicultural:
- **Mexican/Tejano** majority (~50%)
- **American outlaws** (~30%)
- **Native renegades** (~10%)
- **European immigrants** (~5%)
- **Chinese laborers** fleeing railroad work (~3%)
- **Black freemen and escaped slaves** (~2%)

This creates a cultural blend:
- Spanish-English code-switching
- Vaquero/cowboy fusion culture
- Catholic-indigenous-Protestant religious mix
- Unique frontier cuisine
- Shared outlaw mythology

**Economic Model**:

The Frontera survives through:
- **Smuggling** (guns, alcohol, luxury goods)
- **Stolen goods fencing** (cattle, horses, gold)
- **Mercenary work** (all sides hire them secretly)
- **Gambling and vice** (saloons, brothels, opium dens)
- **Information brokering** (spying, intelligence)
- **Protection rackets** (pay us or get raided)

**Relationship to the Conflict**:

The Frontera doesn't want either the Settlers or Coalition to win:
- **Settler victory** = law and order = outlaws hunted down
- **Coalition victory** = less economic opportunity (settlers have money)
- **Continued stalemate** = maximum profit and freedom

So they play both sides:
- Sell guns to Coalition resistance
- Fence stolen goods for settler ranchers
- Take mercenary contracts from the Army
- Hide Coalition fugitives for payment
- Raid both settler and native settlements

**Internal Factions**:

**The Pragmatists** (El Rey's faction):
- Keep the chaos profitable but controlled
- Enforce the Frontera Code
- Avoid making enemies that could unite against them

**The Anarchists** (various wild gangs):
- Want total lawlessness
- See the Code as weakness
- Will betray anyone for short-term gain
- Usually die young in duels or raids

**The Idealists** (rare):
- Believe the Frontera could be a true free society
- Want to build something beyond outlawry
- Sympathetic to Coalition cause (oppressed people)
- Usually end up choosing the Coalition or settlers

**Supernatural Relationship**:

The Frontera has a unique relationship with the supernatural:

- **"Prophet"** (mysterious fortune teller) has genuine supernatural abilities
- Many Frontera outlaws are superstitious (charms, rituals, folk magic)
- They've learned from natives that the spirits are real
- Some even undergo vision quests or seek spirit guidance
- The supernatural is a tool to be exploited like everything else

**Strengths**:
- Mobility and flexibility (no territory to defend)
- Intelligence networks (spies everywhere)
- Ruthless pragmatism (no ideology limits tactics)
- Economic leverage (control black markets)
- Multicultural knowledge (speak many languages, understand many cultures)
- Expendable - losses don't matter like they do to the other factions

**Weaknesses**:
- Internal instability (gangs fight each other)
- No long-term vision (live day to day)
- Hated by both other factions
- Can't hold territory (no army)
- Many are wanted criminals (bounties on their heads)
- No moral high ground (seen as parasites)

**Relationship to the Destiny Deck**:

The Frontera sees the Destiny Deck as pure gambling - a way to win through cunning and luck.

- Poker is their cultural pastime (every saloon has games)
- They respect skill but worship luck
- "The cards decide" is their version of fate
- Cheating is expected (and admired if you get away with it)
- The best poker players have highest status

They don't see the spiritual significance, but they understand the system intuitively.

## MYTHOLOGY & THE SUPERNATURAL

*(Overview - Full detail in Mythology & Supernatural Codex)*

### The Nature of the Supernatural

**In Desperados Destiny, the supernatural is objectively real.**

This isn't folklore, superstition, or hallucination. Spirits exist. Legendary beasts exist. Sacred sites have power. The Ancient Pact is real.

**However**, the supernatural follows rules:

1. **It is local to the Sangre Territory** (Thin Ground effect)
2. **It is unpredictable but not random** (it responds to balance and violation)
3. **It can be interacted with** (through ritual, respect, or violence)
4. **It has quasi-scientific undertones** (geological/psychological explanations possible but incomplete)
5. **Belief affects experience** (skeptics encounter it less but still encounter it)

### The Three Layers of Mystery

**Layer 1: The Thin Ground (Kia'ta)**
- Geological/spiritual reality that the barrier between worlds is thin here
- Ancient tectonic activity? Magnetic anomalies? Spiritual nexus? All three?
- Creates conditions for supernatural activity

**Layer 2: The Primordial Sleeper (What-Waits-Below)**
- Something vast and ancient beneath the territory
- Connected to The Scar
- Neither good nor evil, but utterly alien
- The Ancient Pact keeps it sleeping

**Layer 3: The Blood Pact**
- The bargain the First People made
- "Feed the land with your lives" = live and die here, be buried here
- In return, the land provides
- Violation = awakening the sleeper

### Spirit Classification

**Ancestor Spirits**:
- Ghosts of the dead who remain to guide descendants
- Generally benevolent but can be dangerous if disrespected
- Appear as translucent figures, voices, dreams
- Strongest near burial sites

**Land Guardians**:
- Spirits tied to specific locations (springs, mountains, caves)
- Protect sacred sites from violation
- Can be negotiated with through proper ritual
- Attack violators (the Canyon Wyrm, Thunderbird)

**Trickster Spirits**:
- Coyote, Raven, and other shapeshifters
- Neither good nor evil - chaotic and testing
- Play deadly games with humans
- Can grant wisdom or bring disaster

**The Old Ones**:
- Ancient entities from before human time
- Incomprehensible motivations
- What-Waits-Below is one of these
- Encountering them risks madness

### The Ten Legendary Beasts

*(Brief overview - full detail in Mythology Codex)*

1. **Thunderbird** - Massive eagle-like creature, creates storms
2. **What-Waits-Below** - The entity beneath The Scar
3. **Pale Rider** - Death omen, appears before disasters
4. **Canyon Wyrm** - Serpentine earth guardian
5. **Skinwalker Pack** - Shapeshifting witches (hostile to all)
6. **Bone Mother** - Spirit of the dead, rules Bone Garden
7. **Coyote King** - Chief trickster spirit
8. **Iron Horse Revenant** - Ghost train/spectral locomotive
9. **Dust Devils** - Sentient dust storms
10. **Mirror Men** - Doppelgangers that steal identities

### Sacred Sites and Their Powers

Each sacred site grants or punishes:

**The Scar**: Visions of the past and future, but risk madness
**Thunderbird's Perch**: Storm power, lightning visions
**Whispering Stones**: Knowledge of the dead, but drains life
**Ancestor's Spring**: (Destroyed - now grants bitter visions of what was lost)
**Bone Garden**: Speak with specific dead, but must leave offering
**Echo Caves**: Hear future echoes, acoustic divination
**Coyote's Crossroads**: Test of wisdom, trickster trials
**Railroad Wound**: New site - grants industrial visions, but curses progress

### Vision Quests

The Nahi Coalition tradition of vision quests is real and mechanically significant:

**Five Phases**:
1. **Intention** - State what you seek
2. **Preparation** - Fasting, ritual purification
3. **Journey** - Travel to sacred site
4. **Trial** - Survive supernatural test
5. **Reward** - Gain vision, blessing, or spirit guide

**Game Mechanics**: Vision quests are high-level content that grant permanent buffs, unique skills, or critical story revelations.

### The Great Mystery - Story Arc

The six-layer revelation of the truth about the Sangre Territory:

**Layer 1** (Early Game): "Strange things happen here"
**Layer 2** (Mid Game): "The natives were right - spirits are real"
**Layer 3** (Late Game): "The Ancient Pact is real and breaking"
**Layer 4** (Endgame): "What-Waits-Below is waking up"
**Layer 5** (Climax): "We must choose - stop the violation or face the consequences"
**Layer 6** (Resolution): "The fate of the territory is decided by player actions"

### Supernatural Encounter Frequency

**Design Goal**: 2-3 meaningful supernatural encounters per week of active play

- Most are minor (strange sounds, ghostly figures, unexplained events)
- Some are interactive (spirits who speak, tests, choices)
- Rare encounters with legendary beasts (high-level content)
- Sacred site visits always trigger something

**Skepticism vs. Belief**:
- Skeptical players still encounter the supernatural but may rationalize it longer
- Believing players (especially Coalition) encounter it more frequently
- No player can avoid it completely - it's objectively real

## CONCLUSION: THE MOMENT OF CRISIS

**May 1875 - The Game's Present**

The Sangre Territory stands at the brink of catastrophe.

**The Settler Alliance** sees unlimited wealth and the triumph of civilization. They will mine The Scar regardless of consequences.

**The Nahi Coalition** sees the end of their world and the breaking of the Ancient Pact. They will fight to extinction to prevent it.

**The Frontera** sees opportunity in chaos but also fear that something terrible is about to be unleashed.

**The Supernatural World** is in upheaval. Spirits are appearing more frequently. Legendary beasts are stirring. The land itself seems to be holding its breath.

**What-Waits-Below** is waking up.

**Players arrive at this moment.** Their choices will determine:
- Which faction gains dominance
- Whether The Scar is mined or protected
- If the Ancient Pact can be restored or if it's too late
- What happens when What-Waits-Below fully awakens
- The fate of the Sangre Territory

**This is the historical foundation upon which Desperados Destiny is built.**

Every NPC, quest, location, and event draws from this timeline. Every faction has legitimate grievances and understandable motivations. Every supernatural element has roots in the Ancient Pact.

The cards are about to be dealt. The Destiny Deck is shuffling.

**What hand will you play?**
