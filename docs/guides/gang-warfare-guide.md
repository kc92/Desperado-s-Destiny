## Card-Based Battle System

Gang warfare uses a unique card-based combat system separate from individual combat.

### Building Your War Deck
Your gang war deck represents your gang's tactical capabilities:

- **Attack Cards** - Direct offensive actions
- **Defense Cards** - Protect held positions
- **Sabotage Cards** - Disrupt enemy operations
- **Support Cards** - Buff allies, heal positions
- **Special Cards** - Unique gang abilities

### Battle Resolution
1. Both sides play cards simultaneously
2. Card effects resolve by priority
3. Damage applied to control points
4. Survivors contribute to next round
5. Territory changes based on final score

### Deck Building Tips
- Balance offense and defense
- Include counter cards for common strategies
- Coordinate with gang members on specializations
- Upgrade cards through gang treasury investments
