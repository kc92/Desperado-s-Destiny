## Moral Reputation (Marshal vs Outlaw)

Separate from karma, your public moral standing is tracked on a single scale:

### The Scale
```
-100 ◄─────────── 0 ───────────► +100
 OUTLAW           NEUTRAL         MARSHAL
```

### Reputation Tiers

| Score | Title | Effects |
|-------|-------|---------|
| -100 to -80 | **Notorious Outlaw** | Shoot on sight, max bounty |
| -79 to -60 | **Wanted Criminal** | High bounty, hostile lawmen |
| -59 to -40 | **Known Rogue** | Watched carefully |
| -39 to -20 | **Suspicious Character** | Minor hostility |
| -19 to +19 | **Unknown** | Neutral treatment |
| +20 to +39 | **Upstanding Citizen** | Lawman trust |
| +40 to +59 | **Respected Deputy** | Access to law resources |
| +60 to +79 | **Renowned Marshal** | Authority in towns |
| +80 to +100 | **Legendary Marshal** | Heroes' treatment |

### Access Gates
Some content is locked behind reputation:
- **-20 or below**: Outlaw hideouts, black markets, fence operations
- **+20 or above**: Sheriff quests, bounty hunting, law equipment

### Daily Decay
- Reputation slowly drifts toward 0 over time
- Active deeds maintain your standing
- Extreme actions can shift it rapidly
