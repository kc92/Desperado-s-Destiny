## Worker Optimization

### Minimum Viable Team

- Mine: 4-5 workers (1 prospector, 3-4 miners)
- Workshop: 3-4 specialists (1 each type)
- Saloon: 3-4 workers (bartender, cook, entertainer)
- Stable: 2-3 workers (trainer, breeder, hand)

### Optimal Team
- High skill (60+) specialist for each product type
- 1-2 forepeople for bonus
- Mix of efficiency + quality traits
- Backup workers for rotation

### Budget Team
- Skill 20-40 workers with no negative traits
- Focus on laborers (cheap, versatile)
- Train up slowly over time
- Accept lower quality/speed

## Time Management

### Active Sessions (1-2 hours)
- Start: Repairs, Horseshoes, Milk, Coal
- Collect frequently for immediate gold

### Medium Sessions (4-8 hours)
- Start: Most crafted goods, training, ore
- Set before work/sleep, collect on return

### Passive Income (24 hours)
- Start: Breeding, boarding, rooms
- Minimal management, steady income

### Rush Strategy
- Use for urgent needs or limited play time
- Best on high-margin products
- Calculate: Is 2-3x cost worth immediate result?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-hiring**: Too many workers = high wage costs
2. **Under-training**: Low skill = poor quality/yield
3. **Ignoring Morale**: Low morale = strikes/quits
4. **Wrong Specialists**: Need right worker for special products
5. **No Reserve Gold**: Can't pay wages = lose workers
6. **Ignoring Quality**: Higher quality = much better yield
7. **Rush Everything**: Expensive and often not needed
8. **No Auto-Sell**: Inventory bloat from uncollected goods

## Production Formulas

### Production Time
```
Final Time = Base Time × (1 - Slot Speed) × (1 - Worker Speed) × (1 - Multi-Worker Bonus)
If Rushed: Final Time × 0.25
```

### Yield Calculation
```
Base Yield = Product Base Quantity × Order Quantity
Quality Modified = Base Yield × Quality Modifier (0.8 - 1.5)
Bonus Applied = Quality Modified × (1 + Slot Yield) × (1 + Worker Yield)
Final = Clamp(Bonus Applied, Min Quantity, Max Quantity)
```

### Quality Roll
```
Roll = Random(0-1)
Roll += Slot Quality Bonus
Roll += (Character Craft Skill / 200)
Roll += Sum(Worker Quality Bonuses)

If Roll >= 0.95: Masterwork
Else If Roll >= 0.80: Excellent
Else If Roll >= 0.60: Good
Else If Roll >= 0.20: Standard
Else: Poor
```

### Rush Cost
```
Rush Cost = (Base Gold Cost × Quantity) × Rush Multiplier (2.0-3.0)
Total Cost = Base Cost + Rush Cost
```
