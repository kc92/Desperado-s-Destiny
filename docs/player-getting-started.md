## Understanding Energy

## Combat Basics

Combat uses a Hold/Discard poker-style Destiny Deck system.

### How Combat Works
Unlike traditional card games, you **draw 5 cards** and decide which to **hold** and which to **discard**:

1. **Draw Phase** - Receive 5 cards from your deck
2. **Decision Phase** - Choose which cards to HOLD (keep) or DISCARD (replace)
3. **Redraw Phase** - Discarded cards are replaced with new draws
4. **Resolution** - Your final hand determines damage dealt

### Poker Hand Rankings
Your final 5-card hand is evaluated like poker:

| Hand | Damage Multiplier |
|------|-------------------|
| High Card | 1.0x |
| Pair | 1.25x |
| Two Pair | 1.5x |
| Three of a Kind | 1.75x |
| Straight | 2.0x |
| Flush | 2.25x |
| Full House | 2.5x |
| Four of a Kind | 3.0x |
| Straight Flush | 4.0x |
| Royal Flush | 5.0x |

### Suit Bonuses
Each suit provides a bonus effect:
- **♠ Spades** - Critical hit chance
- **♥ Hearts** - Healing effect
- **♦ Diamonds** - Gold bonus on win
- **♣ Clubs** - Defense bonus

### Combat Abilities
As you level up, you unlock special abilities:

| Ability | Level | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Reroll** | 30+ | Discard and redraw cards again |
| **Peek** | 50 | See opponent's hand before deciding |
| **Quick Draw** | 60+ | Strike first, ignoring speed |
| **Deadly Aim** | 75+ | Guarantee critical on next attack |

### Combat Tips
- **Build strong poker hands** - Full House beats raw card values
- **Match suits** for extra bonuses
- **Use abilities wisely** - They have cooldowns
- **Flee** if losing badly (costs energy)
- **Check enemy level** before fighting
